## Shut the Box JS Game

* I used jQuery as my primary JS framework. Most manipulation of the HTML occurs using jQuery selectors.
* The code is all home-grown, with the exception of the libraries I used for the 'bonus points'. Core JS files and CSS were written from scratch.
* The cards/tiles for the game are created using a library called flip.
* The dice were based off an open-source project found [here](http://www.andrewmaul.com/fun/DiceRoller/index.html). The animations and related js/css were based off code hosted there and adapted for context of this project.
* I separated the code out into logical pieces, even though some of the js files (namely, the templates) were relatively small. 

* The best [live] working version can be found at http://shutthebox.paperplane.io/. This website pulls directly from the github repo, and has all styling and web fonts intact.
